1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,375
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,791
Gods, show me your power.

3
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:27,541
For that I will sacrifice
what is most precious to me.

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,375
My firstborn.

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Runa?

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,166
Runa!

7
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,958
What's the hurry?

8
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,791
The oath. Before the great battle.

9
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,958
I begged the gods to help me
avenge my family and free my tribe.

10
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,833
How nice. They answered you.

11
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,458
I promised them I would

12
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,375
sacrifice my firstborn.

13
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,208
Tell me now
what I have to do to revoke this oath!

14
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,208
Runa!

15
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,750
Anything. I'm prepared to do anything.

16
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,333
Anything, yes?

17
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,958
To retract your oath?

18
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:03,250
You want to bargain,
but the gods don't make bad bargains.

19
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,416
Anything?

20
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,833
The gods take what they want,
one way or another.

21
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,416
Ari is not to be trusted.

22
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,250
You know why he knelt, don't you?

23
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a trick to get to your troops.

24
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,791
He's luring you
with power you already have.

25
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,333
In return, you have to solve
the tribes' problems.

26
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,708
I can't turn my back on the tribes now.

27
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,583
Let's go home.

28
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,625
And not risk our good relations with Rome.

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,083
You kneel to the man
who sold you out to the Romans?

30
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,625
It was the best option.

31
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,291
And now we have to celebrate with him too?

32
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,916
Host him. In our village.

33
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,083
I had no other choice.

34
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,375
There's always a choice.

35
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,291
You Romans killed my brother!

36
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,041
I'm Segimer's son, Reik Ari's brother!
I demand respect.

37
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,708
Flavus! Uncle!

38
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,541
Gaius.

39
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,125
You're okay.

40
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,375
Out of the way!

41
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,291
-What are you doing here?
-I'm here on a diplomatic mission.

42
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,375
Can we speak privately?

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,750
A gift from General Tiberius.

44
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,291
As a token of his loyalty and… his trust

45
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,000
in our new alliance.

46
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,125
And a message.

47
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,291
For you. A private one.

48
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,583
What are you doing here?

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,625
He's under my protection.

50
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,291
Flavus is here as an envoy of Rome.

51
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,625
I don't want to argue with you.

52
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,583
What do you want, then?

53
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,166
I no longer know what you want.

54
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,916
A war with the Marcomanni?
That's exactly what Rome wants.

55
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,666
-For us to tear each other apart.
-So you kneel before Marbod?

56
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:44,000
-He thinks he can have peace with Rome.
-There is no peace with Rome.

57
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,916
He'll realize that soon enough.

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,916
And what price
will we pay in the meantime?

59
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,625
What else has to happen
before he realizes?

60
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,416
You're putting our future
in Marbod's hands.

61
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,875
I know what peace with Rome looks like.

62
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,083
I was there when your people
crucified Folkwin's family.

63
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,958
And when they crippled my brother!

64
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,000
Over there…

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,750
Dido is dying because of you.

66
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,416
And next door, your traitor brother
is here as a guest.

67
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,125
Marbod as king of all tribes?

68
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,625
Peace with Rome?
Do you even hear yourself?

69
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,791
Then suggest something better.

70
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,166
Suggest something better!

71
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,833
Instead of just being against everything.

72
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,625
I don't have a solution.

73
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,333
Of course you don't!

74
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,291
Because you don't know
what it means to be the reik.

75
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,250
To have responsibility! I'm the reik,

76
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,625
and when I have decisions to make,
I make them!

77
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,708
I sacrificed everything I had.

78
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,416
I had to leave my son behind
to free you all.

79
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,125
I don't think you have a problem
turning your back on people.

80
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,416
Excuse me?

81
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,083
You turned your back on your son.

82
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:22,250
Like you turned your back on your tribe,
and like you turned your back on me today!

83
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,875
Because you're a traitor!

84
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,625
Careful what you say.

85
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,875
You betrayed your foster father!

86
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,958
And you led thousands of people
who trusted you to their deaths.

87
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,916
And for whom?
For the people you betrayed today.

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,125
Be careful what you say!

89
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,791
I… I don't know
who you really are anymore.

90
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,250
Mother?

91
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,875
Thusnelda. Nice to see you.

92
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,791
So you're thieves now?

93
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,958
Yes. This is what I've become. A thief.

94
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,625
Thusnelda, please.
Let us back into the tribe.

95
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,416
Forgive. Show you have a heart.

96
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,250
We're rotting in a cave,
and winter's coming.

97
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,000
Think of your brother. He's starving.

98
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,416
Then bring him to me, finally.

99
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,125
I can take care of him.

100
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,041
In the way he needs.

101
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
And the way he deserves.

102
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,916
And you can come to the village too.

103
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,541
You two don't need to starve.

104
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,666
Or steal.

105
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,416
And Segestes?

106
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,041
He's your father.

107
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,875
That's why I know him so well.

108
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,291
Well enough to prevent him
spreading his poison here.

109
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,500
Your father will never allow

110
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,333
your brother and I to live here
while he's in exile.

111
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,375
Then so be it.

112
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,541
Your decision.

113
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,750
You know where to find me.

114
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,500
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

115
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm glad you're all right.

116
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,166
Tiberius is smart enough to know
that the alliance with you is important.

117
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,958
And I'm safe
as long as I'm under your protection.

118
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,500
Please get some rest.

119
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,791
My men will protect you.

120
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,875
Thank you.

121
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,125
I'll be back soon.

122
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,750
No one goes in or out.

123
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,750
They want Flavus' head

124
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,375
as a sign of your loyalty.

125
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,458
In return, they'll meet all your demands.

126
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,000
Tiberius knows that Flavus is a friend.

127
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,583
One sacrifice

128
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,916
for the future of your people?

129
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,333
Our future, Marbod.

130
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,125
You'll do the right thing.

131
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,250
Dido.

132
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,000
Her spirit is on a journey
so that her body can heal.

133
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,708
Should I

134
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,125
make a sacrifice, or something?

135
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,291
Better to settle your old debts

136
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,750
before you make new deals with the gods.

137
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,625
Gods,

138
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:14,083
I thank you for the victory
over the Romans, and avenging my family.

139
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,416
But what use
is the life of a small child to you

140
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,333
on your journeys through the forests
and the dark night sky?

141
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,416
Or the life of a non-believer?

142
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,833
I renounce…

143
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,166
my firstborn.

144
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,541
I banish him…

145
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,750
from my life

146
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,250
and…

147
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,666
from my heart.

148
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,458
And if it is a human life
that you require…

149
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,333
then take mine.

150
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,166
Then take… mine!

151
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:25,666
Take mine!

152
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,083
Take mine.

153
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,583
United in peace, united in battle.

154
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,916
Thanks to our alliance with Rome,
we'll all be rich.

155
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,708
All of us.

156
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,875
War is expensive and bad for business.

157
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,458
Where there's wealth, there's war.

158
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,708
My dear,

159
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:49,958
eventually you too will realize
not everything Rome has to offer is bad.

160
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,750
Your husband, for example.

161
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,291
Rome doesn't look for friends.

162
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,000
Rome finds subordinates.

163
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,333
Because why should they share
what they can take by force?

164
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,750
Meat, anyone?

165
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
No, thanks.

166
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,250
It cuts well.

167
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,083
A lovely gift from Tiberius.

168
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,708
For Flavus.

169
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,375
What does Tiberius want?

170
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,541
Come with me to the east.

171
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,208
I'll give you lands.

172
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,500
You can be your own master.

173
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,708
Everything just as we used to hope.

174
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,166
I'm a Roman, Marbod.

175
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,166
And an officer too.

176
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,458
I want to drink wine in taverns
after victorious military campaigns.

177
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,916
I want to walk in the streets

178
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,875
where we used to walk together.

179
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,083
Not sit alone in a hut,

180
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,250
master of a thousand herds of pigs.

181
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,000
That's how you see it?

182
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,916
Herds of pigs.

183
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,208
Everyone has a place
where they belong, Marbod.

184
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,041
Yes.

185
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,541
Don't touch me, you barbarian swine!

186
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,458
I'm an envoy of Rome!

187
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,583
Try to have little fun.

188
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,833
The pork is good.

189
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm not hungry.

190
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,791
Then use the evening
to get mead-drunk for the first time.

191
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,041
I hate alcohol.

192
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,750
Flavus will take me to Rome.

193
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,875
You're free to go.

194
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,250
But before you decide to…

195
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,458
come with me to the folkmoot.

196
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,125
And what happens at this… folkmoot?

197
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,791
We… choose the bravest
of our young warriors.

198
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,791
Someone like you.

199
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,833
And then,

200
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,208
we sacrifice him to Wodan.

201
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,625
No, we…

202
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,583
We'll elect Marbod
as king of all the tribes.

203
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,000
And why should I be there?

204
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,958
I'd like you to light the Cheruscan torch.

205
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,958
It's a great honor.

206
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Honor?

207
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,583
You hold your brother captive
like a beast,

208
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,166
and speak of honor?

209
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,041
Rome tells us lies.

210
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,833
Says we're stupid and primitive.

211
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,541
That subjugation is the best thing for us.

212
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,666
Just like the Britons,
the Gauls, the Pannonians.

213
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,916
Rome is the wild beast
that has to be destroyed.

214
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,583
What is it?

215
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,166
A wolf's tooth.

216
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,583
A memory from my childhood.

217
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,083
Life is hard here, simple.

218
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
But I had a happy childhood.

219
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:08,958
And I want

220
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
you to be happy too.

221
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,666
Think about it.

222
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,708
Folkwin.

223
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:57,416
You… You asked me to look after my s…

224
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:06,041
After… Thumelicus,
if anything was to happen to you.

225
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,625
I can't do that anymore.

226
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:18,333
Before the battle with Varus, we…
We were all prepared to give our all, and

227
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,375
so was I.

228
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,250
What did you do?

229
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,958
I promised the gods
I'd sacrifice my firstborn.

230
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,958
I couldn't have known that you…

231
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,375
-If you so much as look at him…
-I'll never see him again.

232
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,958
I've renounced him.

233
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,625
And offered the gods my life.

234
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,625
I'm leaving all of this.

235
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,833
This isn't a threat, it's…

236
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,083
It's a good… A goodbye.

237
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,166
This is a goodbye.

238
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,291
Enjoying yourself?

239
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,625
I know the frustration

240
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,375
of finding oneself in inferior company.

241
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,750
Don't worry.

242
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,416
You're still young.

243
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:31,041
You'll find your rightful place.

244
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,333
My rightful place is in Rome.

245
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,750
Flavus will take me there.

246
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:46,666
I'm sure you'll make it back
to Rome one day.

247
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,000
You're a smart boy.

248
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,625
But I'm not so sure about your uncle.

249
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,375
What's that supposed to mean?

250
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,583
Empty.

251
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,625
I need something to drink.

252
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,666
Flavus? Flavus!

253
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,375
-You have to leave.
-Gaius.

254
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:08,166
Our scouts still see no signs
of larger troop movements.

255
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,125
No Roman legions for miles around.

256
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,041
Yes.

257
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:25,916
What might this mean,
my great Prefect Arminius?

258
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,750
Come.

259
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,375
Tell us.

260
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,375
Tell us!

261
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,291
Where else are should we fight the Romans?

262
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,083
In the villages?

263
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,166
In the huts?

264
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,333
Or out there in the shit pit?

265
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,625
Oh, no, wait. I've got it.

266
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,250
Here.

267
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:57,500
Here.

268
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,458
Here.

269
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,500
Under the table.

270
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,416
Yes, laugh.

271
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:19,416
No.

272
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:24,708
We will never fight the Romans again.

273
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,291
Thanks to me.

274
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,833
I know what needs to be done.

275
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,083
Music!

276
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,291
Why have you locked me up in here, Marbod?

277
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,125
Tiberius won't like it,

278
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,083
you treating his envoy like this.

279
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,500
Tiberius.

280
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:47,916
Here.

281
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,541
Read it.

282
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,625
Read it!

283
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,708
He wants me to kill you.

284
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,208
Yes, that's what he wants.

285
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,500
But you wouldn't do that.

286
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,916
Think about the two of us.

287
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:33,583
When will you finally see
you're wasting your life?

288
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,583
The Romans are playing with you.

289
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,083
They're laughing at you.

290
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,500
They despise you.

291
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,791
Because you're one of us.

292
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,958
You're so foolish.

293
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,916
And so stubborn.

294
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,416
Rome

295
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,916
doesn't want you.

296
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,583
Rome doesn't love you.

297
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,958
Marbod!

298
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,791
What happened?

299
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,875
Flavus escaped.

300
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,416
Someone helped him.

301
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,583
Someone?
Who would have reason to apart from you?

302
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,250
Divide and conquer.

303
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,000
Tiberius wants to sow discord.

304
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,333
Get some rest.

305
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,083
Tomorrow is a big day.

306
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:16,875
It's time for the folkmoot.

307
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:18,666
Gaius.

308
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,250
Come.

309
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,291
I'll take you to your bed.

310
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,000
I…

311
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,625
I'll come to the folkmoot tomorrow.

312
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,458
Come on.

313
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,291
I can show you a really good time.

314
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,791
-Let me show you a good time, honey.
-No.

315
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,708
I said no.

316
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:44,583
Hey! Who are you?

317
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,833
-A mistake.
-Get lost!

318
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:50,000
I apologize.

319
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,833
What the hell are you doing here?

320
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,875
And why is that head
still on your shoulders?

321
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:10,083
Because it will be more useful to Rome
on my shoulders than on a pike.

322
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,291
I'm here to make you an offer.

323
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,291
I will bring Tiberius
the heads of the reiks.

324
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:27,041
Tonight at the folkmoot,
Marbod will be named king.

325
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,208
All the reiks will be there. Unarmed.

326
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,666
And I can take you there.

327
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,250
And how do you know all this?

328
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:48,750
A true Roman helped me.

329
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,458
No need to be nervous.

330
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,500
I'm not nervous.

331
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,125
I'm looking forward to it.

332
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,166
You're awake?

333
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,291
How are you doing?

334
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,541
Better. That's no reason to slap me.

335
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,583
Let's get out of here tonight.

336
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,166
Ansgar, stop it.

337
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,375
Maybe things are turning for the better.

338
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,750
Ari will proclaim Marbod king
at the folkmoot today.

339
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,375
Who's saying that?

340
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,958
He laid his sword at his feet
in front of his warriors.

341
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:41,083
-What are you planning?
-We'll go to the folkmoot.

342
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:44,250
I'll talk to Marbod.
He is a friend of Rome.

343
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,791
He'll need leaders
who know how to negotiate with the Romans.

344
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,916
Let's get going.

345
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,125
Come on, faster!

346
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,083
-Ansgar, wait.
-That damn boy.

347
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,583
Ansgar!

348
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:12,083
Ansgar. What are you doing?

349
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,333
-You're bleeding.
-Get up!

350
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:17,500
-Come on! Up!
-Leave him alone!

351
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:18,500
Get up!

352
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:20,875
Faster!

353
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,958
Faster! Don't slack off!

354
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,625
Let's go. Come on.

355
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,666
He can't keep going like this.

356
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,083
There's no time.

357
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:36,875
You go on.

358
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:37,958
And you?

359
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:45,500
I'll take him to the Cheruscan village.
It's close.

360
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,708
Go on. Go.

361
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,708
What happened?

362
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,666
We had to hide from the Romans.

363
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:38,666
Were you defending your mother?

364
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,375
Dead men.

365
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,208
They were heading west.

366
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,333
The folkmoot.

367
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:40,125
Sometimes…
a bad peace is better than a good war.

368
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,958
As our king, Reik Marbod will show us

369
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,708
what a good peace with Rome looks like.

370
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:14,375
I don't believe in peace with Rome.

371
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:15,750
You hypocrite.

372
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,541
You knelt before Reik Marbod, Ari!

373
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,750
You've all experienced
what peace with Rome means.

374
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,625
Yet you still believe in it.

375
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Marbod believes in it.

376
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,958
I don't.

377
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,208
I support Marbod as king.

378
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,375
I'm not supporting Marbod

379
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,916
because I believe in the Romans…

380
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,875
but because I believe in us.

381
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:58,041
With Marbod,

382
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,375
we won't just be Cherusci.

383
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:04,958
Or just Marcomanni. Or Marsi.

384
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:06,791
From today,

385
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:12,583
we will stand together as united tribes.

386
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:20,791
And the gods…

387
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,083
will be behind us.

388
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,666
And the Romans

389
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:34,541
will piss their armor rusty in fear.

390
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,250
Because from today,

391
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,625
they'll no longer face individual tribes.

392
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,875
The chains they put on us…
we've torn them off.

393
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:55,083
And now we are forging a mighty sword.

394
00:47:56,416 --> 00:48:00,208
And Rome will tremble before our sword.

395
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,208
In war and in peace!
