1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,333
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,458
Hundreds of boats.
As far as the eye can see.

3
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,500
Only a day's ride away.

4
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:37,208
It's a whole legion. At least 10,000 men.

5
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,375
What about your troops, Marbod?

6
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,333
We can't wait that long
if they're that close.

7
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,583
So we must attack the ships immediately.

8
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,125
How do you propose we do that?

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,916
Can you even swim?

10
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,500
Have you ever seen such a ship?

11
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,500
What about Germanicus?

12
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,583
Tiberius won't do any bargaining.

13
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,958
And he won't keep his word.

14
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,083
We have to attack the camp
before the ships arrive.

15
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,541
I like it. Rob the bird of its nest.

16
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,958
Tiberius summoned the troops
as reinforcements.

17
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,708
If the camp they use
to deploy against us is gone…

18
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,250
They will turn around.

19
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:16,541
But how, Ari, how?
You said yourself we are too few.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,916
Palisades, archers…

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,583
Even getting inside is a hopeless task.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,041
And even if we succeed,
we'll still be outnumbered.

23
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,250
We're worth three Romans each.

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,583
I admire your courage, Thusnelda.

25
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,500
You're a great warrior,
and you want to fight--

26
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,791
I don't want to fight.

27
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:38,541
I didn't want this war.
None of us wanted this war, did we?

28
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,458
The Romans brought it to us.

29
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,083
I'd give anything for a genuine peace.

30
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,375
But there's no peace without freedom.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,666
And that's why I'll do anything,
absolutely anything, for this freedom.

32
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,083
Fine words.

33
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,625
But there isn't enough blood here
to back them up.

34
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,791
Then we just have to mobilize
everyone we have.

35
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,625
Even the elderly.

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,791
Anyone who can hold a sword.

37
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,958
So you want…
to lead your entire people into battle?

38
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,541
If I don't, I won't have a people anymore.

39
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,375
It is nice to see you again.

40
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,750
To see you alive.

41
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,208
I'll fight for the Cherusci, Father.

42
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,791
I'll do everything I can to--

43
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,500
I can't lose you again.

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,625
You're a child.

45
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,166
You're not a warrior.

46
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,333
Not yet.

47
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,125
-Children don't belong on the battlefield.
-The Romans see no children.

48
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,416
No women, men…

49
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,458
To them, we're all barbarians.

50
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,583
Maybe I can't fight,

51
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,083
but the Romans don't know that.

52
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,833
They just have to believe that I can.

53
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,083
It could work.

54
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,916
It will.

55
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,541
Who goes there? Halt!

56
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,291
Don't shoot. I come alone.

57
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,291
I have information for the commander.

58
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,916
I am Segestes.

59
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:02,666
If you want to survive,
let me speak with him.

60
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,083
Go tell the prefect.

61
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,250
Like I said,

62
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:12,166
I want refuge in Rome
and enough gold for a decent life.

63
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,166
No man does
something like this just for gold.

64
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,458
That's something
only a man with a lot of gold would say.

65
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,500
Sir.

66
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,583
What have you got to say
before I have you flogged?

67
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,833
They know about the ships.

68
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,208
And Marbod will do anything
to avenge his wife.

69
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,500
They've taken Germanicus captive.

70
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,250
He's an idiot.

71
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,458
He was an idiot.

72
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,208
Unfortunately.

73
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,958
They are going to attack. Tomorrow.

74
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,125
They call you a fox.

75
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:04,625
A fox's burrow always has a second exit,
or even a third.

76
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,916
Even though he doesn't need it.

77
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:08,166
Twelve summers ago.

78
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,958
In Carthage.

79
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,083
He was a blacksmith.

80
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,708
With a kind face.

81
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,041
I don't remember.

82
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,458
Killing me won't change that.

83
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,291
Maybe it wasn't even me.

84
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,833
It was.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,875
I remember.

86
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,791
Then what do you need me to say?

87
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:50,291
I need you to beg for my forgiveness.

88
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,791
And I need you

89
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,875
to lick my ass.

90
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,375
He has your lips, Thusnelda.

91
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,166
Thumelicus…

92
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,291
-Can I hold him?
-We have to make preparations.

93
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,333
Thumelicus.

94
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,750
Of course.

95
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,666
What's going on?

96
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,208
What's happening?!

97
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,791
Hey, men!

98
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,625
Silence, traitor!

99
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,166
Preparations are going well.

100
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,916
However, we are not informed
about how many they are.

101
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,250
As long as we secure the camp
for the ships to berth, we will be fine.

102
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,541
As you command, Dominus.

103
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,333
Good.

104
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:57,458
Any news about Germanicus?

105
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:02,958
Nothing. But are you sure you don't want
a squad to rescue him, Dominus?

106
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,166
No one goes in or out.

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Not until the ships arrive.

108
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,000
I think you want to kill me…

109
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,916
but…

110
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,625
I also think you know
I'm more valuable alive…

111
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,583
than as a sacrifice to some memory.

112
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't tempt me.

113
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,041
Dido!

114
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,625
Sleep well, my darling.

115
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,000
You'll survive tonight
because we need you.

116
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,458
But I promise you, by this time tomorrow,

117
00:11:55,541 --> 00:12:00,291
I'll have cut off your filthy Roman cock
and fed it to the pigs.

118
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,041
Sleep well,

119
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,208
my darling.

120
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,291
Dido!

121
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,541
Don't run away again.

122
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,916
You did it once already.

123
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,000
Without a goodbye. Without a word.

124
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:41,041
I didn't want to involve anyone else.
Least of all you.

125
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,958
But it's not that simple.

126
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,625
You saved me back then
when I had no one else.

127
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,583
Folkwin,

128
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,583
we've always said

129
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,541
we owe each other nothing.

130
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,625
You have to find your own way.

131
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,791
Alone.

132
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,416
But what if…

133
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,666
my way leads me to you?

134
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,958
Tomorrow we fight.

135
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,666
Together.

136
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,166
Then we'll both be free.

137
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,250
Gaius…

138
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,250
Why isn't he on the other side?

139
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,125
He has the right
to choose his own fate too.

140
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,125
It's started! To the east gate!

141
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,750
To arms! Hurry!

142
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,083
They've gathered in the forest
on the east side.

143
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,541
Ten thousand barbarians. At least.

144
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,333
When will the ships arrive?

145
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,375
Tonight.

146
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,000
It can't be more than a few hours.

147
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,333
They're trying to cover their numbers.

148
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,583
Hide how few they really are.

149
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,208
Or how many they are.

150
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,041
Germanicus!

151
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,875
Quick, open the gate!

152
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,791
Open the gate!

153
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,208
It's a trap!
They're attacking from the other side.

154
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,000
They're on the other side!

155
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,750
Open the gate!

156
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,458
Attack again!

157
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,708
Open the damn gate!

158
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,166
Where is Tiberius?

159
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,125
Tiberius!

160
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,375
Tiberius!

161
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,166
Marbod!

162
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,666
Marbod!

163
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,500
Marbod.

164
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,916
I'm sorry. For everything.

165
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,791
He's escaping! He's getting away again!

166
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:23,958
No, he isn't.

167
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,250
Folkwin. Hey.

168
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,666
Folkwin.

169
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,375
I hated you so much…

170
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,583
because I loved you so much.

171
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,666
You have to promise me something, Ari.

172
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,333
Anything, my friend. Anything.

173
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,750
You have to love Thumelicus

174
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,958
as if he were your son.

175
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,833
You have to love him like you loved me.

176
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,208
Promise me.

177
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,916
Promise me!

178
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,333
I promise.

179
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,666
I promise.

180
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,541
Folkwin…

181
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,250
Folkwin…

182
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,541
Father!

183
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:01,541
Father.

184
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,583
No one had seen you and…

185
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,708
Get on your horse.

186
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,375
Get on your horse!

187
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,500
A Roman soldier fights to the end!

188
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,250
To the death!

189
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,208
-For Rome!
-A soldier does!

190
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,125
Not the future Caesar!

191
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:28,375
He must know when a battle
is no longer worth fighting!

192
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,291
My men are fighting!

193
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,166
What kind of Caesar deserts his men?

194
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,625
Germania is one of many provinces.
And this camp is one of many.

195
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,625
One day,

196
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:52,791
you can decide
to burn down all of Germania.

197
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,125
So long as…

198
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,125
you get on your horse right now.

199
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
For Rome!

200
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,416
It's wrong, Father.

201
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,500
Folkwin?

202
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,041
Folkwin?

203
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,125
Folkwin.

204
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,375
The ships are turning around!

205
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,250
We three were so young
when the wolf attacked.

206
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,000
We thought the world belonged to us.

207
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,250
But the wolf taught us
that death is always near.

208
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,500
And we promised to protect each other.

209
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,416
Until the end.

210
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,958
The world is full of men who conquer,

211
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,083
and those who stand in their way.

212
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:10,333
And just when you think
there's nothing more they can take,

213
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,625
they find a way
to draw you back into battle.

214
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,625
Ansgar!

215
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,333
What happened?

216
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,541
What happened here?

217
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,458
Ansgar?

218
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,750
Ansgar?

219
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,208
Thumelicus…

220
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,750
-What about him?
-Thumelicus!

221
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,291
Ansgar?

222
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,875
People talk of glory and honor in battle.

223
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,541
But there is only life or death.

224
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,916
So much blood was shed.

225
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,000
Theirs and ours blend in the mud.

226
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,625
We bring children into this world

227
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,916
in the hope
that it will be better for them.

228
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,500
Life exists in the gaps between battles.

229
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,166
There, where love can grow.

230
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:55,375
I don't think we'll still live like this
in a thousand summers.

231
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,583
Maybe the gaps will get bigger.

232
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,791
But we're here in the now.

233
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,416
Fighting for the freedom of our people.

234
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,208
For the freedom of our children.

235
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,666
Thumelicus.

236
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,500
I said I would give anything
for this freedom.

237
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,750
Stop!

238
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,291
You'd better not, Thusnelda.

239
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,791
Thusnelda…

240
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,458
He'll be fine in Rome.

241
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,125
Drop your weapons.

242
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,125
I had no idea what that meant.

243
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,958
I've done my part.

244
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,750
I love betrayal.

245
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:38,250
But I hate a traitor.

246
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,791
But… we had an agreement.

247
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,958
Mother and child shouldn't be separated.

248
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,916
You are coming with us to Rome.

249
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:07,958
But by the gods, tomorrow we will be free.
