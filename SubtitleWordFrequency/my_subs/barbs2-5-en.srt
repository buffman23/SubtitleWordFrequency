00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,291
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,916
This is it, Flavus.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,041
For Rome.

4
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:21,791
Draw!

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,333
Release!

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Draw!

7
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:37,833
Release!

8
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,333
Take cover!

9
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,666
Draw!

10
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,875
Release!

11
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,541
Draw!

12
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,041
Release!

13
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,541
Draw!

14
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,583
Release!

15
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,583
Gaius.

16
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,041
Draw!

17
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,416
Release!

18
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,708
Draw!

19
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,583
Release!

20
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,083
Release!

21
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,500
Draw!

22
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,583
Stand down.

23
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,583
Retreat!

24
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,375
Odvulf, stay with us.

25
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,791
Stay with us, brother.

26
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,416
Gaius… he…

27
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,708
I know.

28
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,750
Brother.

29
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,583
Stay with us.

30
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,500
Brother, stay with us.

31
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,083
Stay with us!

32
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,750
-Let him go, Talio.
-Stay with us! Brother!

33
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,666
Germanicus slaughtered the savages!

34
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,958
Hail!

35
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,666
Hail Caesar!

36
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:14,083
Tell us, Proconsul. Tell us!
What happened?

37
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,375
What happened?

38
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:21,250
We showed those savages
whose lands these really are!

39
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,041
Hurrah!

40
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,041
You want me, you'll get me.

41
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,125
It was Marbod who couldn't see
that Rome's promises don't last.

42
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,375
I knew something like this was coming.

43
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,083
But not how soon.

44
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,541
Imagine if Folkwin hadn't been here.

45
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,750
Dido?

46
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,708
Where is she?

47
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,916
She said to tell you
that you owe her nothing.

48
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,125
Nothing.

49
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,000
She left.

50
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,291
Where to?

51
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,000
To settle a long-outstanding debt.

52
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,541
For her own sake.

53
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,875
Anything else?

54
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,625
One wonders, is all this due to you

55
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,916
not keeping your promise to the gods?

56
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,250
I am keeping my promise to the gods.
The child is no longer mine.

57
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,875
Then I hope the gods see it that way too.

58
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,250
For your sake.

59
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,666
Reiks, swordsmen, women, Marbod's wife…
they're all dead.

60
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:41,166
The tribes won't take that lying down.
That much is certain.

61
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,458
We'll stay in the village for now.

62
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,875
You were banished, Segestes.
You have to ask her.

63
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,291
No father has to ask his daughter's
permission for anything.

64
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,375
So, what's your plan?

65
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:01,291
My plan? My plan seeped into the ground
with the blood of the tribes!

66
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,916
They've ruined everything!

67
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,791
If I'd been reik,
this would never have happened.

68
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,750
A good leader knows
how to use a defeat to his advantage.

69
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you really capable of that, Segestes?

70
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,458
Or can you only moan
like an old washerwoman?

71
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,000
Proconsul Germanicus.

72
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,916
-Centurion Flavus.
-Dominus.

73
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,250
I see… that you have made Caesar proud!

74
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,666
Hooray for Germanicus!

75
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,833
Long live Gaius!

76
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:50,125
Now, there are many things
to be discussed.

77
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,375
Hail Caesar!

78
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,583
Never have I been more ashamed
to call you my son.

79
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,750
Father, but we--

80
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,375
With your thoughtless attack,

81
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,125
you've ruined the intricate illusion
of peace I've been building for months.

82
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,541
-We slaughtered them!
-All of them?

83
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,500
Then you've only motivated
them to retaliate.

84
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,583
Good. We're ready for them.

85
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,458
I should give you up to them.
Buy us some time.

86
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,875
-Father--
-Silence!

87
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,875
I preferred it when you were all talk.

88
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,000
You.

89
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:49,041
-I'd like to explain his plan.
-I gave you clear orders when we last met.

90
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,125
Didn't I?

91
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,083
-I tried to--
-Trying to accomplish something you can't…

92
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,000
That's the theme of your existence.

93
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,333
-That ends now.
-Dominus?

94
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:08,083
-Throw him in the pit.
-General!

95
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,000
And strip him of that uniform.
It's just a costume.

96
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,083
Dominus!

97
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:19,375
Barbarians are approaching the camp.
One's calling for you by name, Dominus.

98
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,416
Tiberius!

99
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,208
Tiberius!

100
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,000
Get down here!

101
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,791
What? No Latin?

102
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,250
I spoke Latin to show you respect.

103
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,958
Respect that I also expected from you.

104
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,875
You have my respect, Marbod.

105
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,291
Oh yeah? Tell that to my wife!

106
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,583
I did not give permission for the attack.

107
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,583
It was Flavus' idea.

108
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,291
And Germanicus bought into it.

109
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,416
Fine.

110
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,291
Then bring them to me.

111
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,458
I can't do that.

112
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,541
Send them out!

113
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,166
Send them out!

114
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,750
Or you can forget our peace treaty.

115
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,166
I have no interest in discord, Marbod.

116
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:36,166
Go home, and let's renew
our peaceful partnership.

117
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,333
There will be no peace, Tiberius.

118
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,833
No peace until the heads
of Germanicus and Flavus are on pikes!

119
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:55,958
Draw!

120
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,291
Release!

121
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,166
Will he fetch his troops?

122
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes. He already gave the order
on his way back.

123
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,166
He can't make the journey
in his condition.

124
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,541
That's true.

125
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,333
What about you?

126
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:49,000
My job is to protect our reik.
I won't leave his side.

127
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,375
I'll fetch them.

128
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,833
No. Too risky.

129
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,208
I'll fetch the Marcomanni.

130
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,250
Whoever goes will have to convince
the army to come here.

131
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,916
But…

132
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,250
Reik Ari of the Cherusci…

133
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,958
He isn't trusted in the east.

134
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,791
I'll go and fetch them, then.

135
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,000
Your tribe needs its reik now.

136
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,416
But you're not going alone.

137
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,041
You're leaving?

138
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,583
Yeah.

139
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,291
Where to?

140
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,833
Away.

141
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,375
Pity.

142
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,416
What do you want?

143
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,000
What do you two want?

144
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,791
Thusnelda's going
to fetch the Marcomanni army.

145
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,958
That's a four-day ride.

146
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,041
Three days.

147
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,416
If you know the way, but you don't.

148
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,708
-Right.
-But you do.

149
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,250
No. No, no, no. Forget it.

150
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,208
-One day can make all the difference.
-Ask… Ask someone else.

151
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,833
You were leaving anyway.

152
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,041
Yes. But I don't want
to have to come back again.

153
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,625
Then ride with me, show me the way,
and then move on.

154
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,291
One more ride,
and you'll be rid of all this.

155
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,791
We both know she'll head off anyway.
Whether you go with her or not.

156
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,541
I'm begging you.

157
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:18,916
Please.

158
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,625
We leave at dawn.

159
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,583
You should sleep.

160
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,250
Stay a bit longer.

161
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,333
What if you don't come back?

162
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,291
That won't happen.

163
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,583
Look at that.

164
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,750
A little boy, all alone in the woods.

165
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:46,375
So…

166
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:57,333
My nose tells me you might know something,
my barbarian boy.

167
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,333
And I can smell your breath, Roman.

168
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:07,916
It's horrible.

169
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,458
Grab him!

170
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,208
Quick!

171
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,291
Damn! Grab him!

172
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,458
Get that little barbarian bastard!

173
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:41,291
If I'd done what she wanted,
we wouldn't be here now.

174
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,750
I think

175
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,833
we'd have been here anyway.

176
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,625
When my army gets here…

177
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,958
then neither of us will rest

178
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,208
until the last Roman
has been driven out of our land.

179
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,416
Can you promise me that?

180
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:20,541
I promise you.

181
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,916
Find him!

182
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,416
He ran off that way!

183
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,125
There are archers all along this side.

184
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,916
That side is out.

185
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,416
And the other sides?

186
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,583
I can't see how.

187
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,708
We'll look more closely at the camp later,
before the troops arrive.

188
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:09,750
Ari?

189
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,083
Segestes.

190
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,833
Can we talk? In private?

191
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,833
What are you doing here, Segestes?

192
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,625
Want to know my plan?

193
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:47,708
So you can go running to Tiberius?
And tell him everything?

194
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,250
I've made mistakes.

195
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,291
Many mistakes.

196
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,458
I don't know any man as old as I am
who hasn't made any mistakes.

197
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,500
I want a fresh start.

198
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:10,041
I want to return to my village.
Here! I'm a Cheruscan.

199
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,541
Even if I were to agree to that,
I'd have to ask Thusnelda.

200
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,625
I'll talk to her when she returns.

201
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,791
She rode off today?

202
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,250
Where to?

203
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:34,041
I'd let you stay here
because you're Thusnelda's father.

204
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,541
Because I think fathers deserve
to reconcile with their children.

205
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,000
No matter what they've done.

206
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,958
Thank you for your compassion.

207
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,666
Segestes?

208
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,875
Just because I have compassion

209
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,166
doesn't mean I'm willing
to put up with just anyone.

210
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,500
There will be war.

211
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,875
And if you want to live here,
you have to earn it.

212
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,916
You'll be a man of this tribe and you'll
fight for the tribe like everyone else.

213
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,500
Ari… I'm not a warrior.

214
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,375
I'm a leader.

215
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:25,375
I can help you lead the tribe.
I have ideas for the future. Here.

216
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,041
I'm not interested.

217
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,250
Show us you have honor,

218
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,541
and fight for the Cherusci.

219
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,375
Pack your things. We're going.

220
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,083
There will be war. Ari's lost his senses.

221
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,833
He'll let the Romans
slaughter his people like pigs.

222
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,916
I don't think he's safe here.

223
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,083
You miserable old
cowardly good-for-nothing!

224
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:16,083
Don't you dare
speak to your husband like that again.

225
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:20,833
That's right.

226
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,458
You're my husband, Segestes.

227
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,000
I married you
because you were worth something.

228
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,166
There will be war, and you want to run.

229
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,500
Where to? Back to that hellhole?

230
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:40,958
No, Segestes! You'll go make sure
that we end up on the winning side.

231
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:46,250
You owe me that
because I've given you everything.

232
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,458
Everything!

233
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,708
Everything?

234
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,958
Are you really prepared
to give everything for this?

235
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,125
What?

236
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:14,958
You're lost?

237
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:20,500
No. It's just that I don't know exactly--

238
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,708
You're lost.

239
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,791
No, I'm not… I haven't gotten…

240
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,541
I can ride through this forest blind.

241
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:36,875
See that hill? Behind it is a clearing
where I killed my first boar.

242
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,458
It was more like a piglet.

243
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,375
Back there's the river. We cross it,

244
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,833
then we ride toward sunset,
then come the foothills. There.

245
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:54,875
Lost, huh?

246
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,333
Germanicus.

247
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,625
I can help you.

248
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,250
Germanicus…

249
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,125
Help me?

250
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,708
Help me?

251
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,083
How?

252
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:38,458
Marbod has 70,000 men.

253
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,041
I know Marbod.

254
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,416
I know Arminius.

255
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,916
We're all like brothers,
born here and raised in Rome.

256
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,125
"Born here and raised in Rome"?

257
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:59,958
The focus shifts
to whatever suits you best, no?

258
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,458
Germanicus,

259
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,125
I know the way these men think.

260
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,458
-It's in my blood!
-Yes. Your barbarian blood.

261
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,000
That's exactly the problem.

262
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,041
Tiberius is wrong.

263
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,500
You brought glory to Rome.

264
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,375
I helped you.

265
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,291
Help me now.

266
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,083
Tiberius is not wrong.

267
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,000
Rome is sacrosanct.

268
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,083
And I would die to protect it.

269
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:48,666
You are just protecting yourself,
and you despise what you are.

270
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,250
And so Rome despises you.

271
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,416
Know who you are, Flavus.

272
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,583
Arminius betrayed Rome.

273
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,500
Your blood betrayed Rome.

274
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,791
You said it yourself.

275
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:10,708
What's running through your veins
is barbarian blood.

276
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:21,083
You are a barbarian.

277
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,166
Get me out of here.

278
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,041
Get me out of here!

279
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:34,125
Germanicus! Get me out of here!

280
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,250
Germanicus!

281
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,041
Germanicus!

282
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,875
Germanicus!

283
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:49,875
Assuming we get
to the clearing's edge unnoticed…

284
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,250
Of course we will.

285
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,041
Assuming it works,

286
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:56,250
we'd have to run across the open field,

287
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,083
and the archers would
shoot us all down immediately.

288
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,250
And then
we'd have to get over the palisades.

289
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,250
That's the way.

290
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:14,500
We go in as soldiers.
We'll pretend we're a unit.

291
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,708
We need armor, uniforms, maybe a standard.

292
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,416
And then?

293
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,416
We open the gates from the inside.

294
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,458
And then?

295
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,041
Let's go collect a few uniforms first.

296
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:45,666
No, thanks.

297
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,208
No, thanks.

298
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,416
At least that hasn't changed.

299
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,000
What?

300
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,583
You act like nothing's wrong.

301
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,708
Yes, I understand you have to be strong
for your… tribe, but…

302
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,625
when it's just the two of us?
In the forest?

303
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,208
What do you want?

304
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,458
Ari… is… is right.

305
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,083
The Marcomanni will follow you.
Everyone will follow you.

306
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,291
But not for the reasons Ari listed.

307
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,541
They'll follow you because…

308
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,333
you don't begin to eat
until everyone else is full.

309
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,083
Is that what I do?

310
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,833
This is about Ari.

311
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,625
No.

312
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,041
This is about…

313
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:03,291
understanding, after all these years,
why you are the way you are.

314
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,291
What's this?

315
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,916
That's dirt.

316
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:28,916
No.

317
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,250
This… is us.

318
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:34,875
Our ancestors.

319
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,666
For me, it's about what was once here.

320
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,958
And what's here today.

321
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:48,208
And what'll be here in a thousand summers
if we can drive the Romans out.

322
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,583
Us, Folkwin.

323
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,833
All of us.

324
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,291
You really believe in

325
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,875
something bigger, huh?

326
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,166
Is that why you chose Ari?

327
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,000
Folkwin…

328
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,583
No matter where you are,

329
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:37,333
whether you hide away
in the furthest mountains, or…

330
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,416
walk to the other end of the world…

331
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,791
you'll always be the one closest to me.

332
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,250
The one who knows me best.

333
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:03,125
Who I don't need to hide anything from.

334
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,208
And can't hide anything from either.

335
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:12,833
Do you love him?

336
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,000
No luck today.

337
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,666
Where'd you say you were from?

338
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,041
Carthage.

339
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,875
Ready to die?

340
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,833
Stop! Calm down.

341
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,250
Calm down.

342
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:16,125
Go! Go away!

343
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,333
You can't kill him.

344
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,958
He murdered my father!

345
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:35,416
We need him.

346
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,583
Forget it.

347
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:52,041
Quiet!

348
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,583
Quiet!

349
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,166
-No! Wait!
-You?

350
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,750
I'll cut you open, you Roman rat.

351
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,166
Folkwin, he's Ari's son.

352
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,333
He's Ari's only son.

353
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,583
Please.

354
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,083
What are you doing here?

355
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,166
I…

356
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,750
I need to show you something.

357
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,375
You need to show us what?

358
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,208
Come on. Quickly!

359
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,208
Why should we trust you?

360
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,208
Tell us.

361
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,541
Otherwise, we're all going to die.

362
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,000
You filthy barbarians need to let me go.

363
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,291
And beg for mercy.

364
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,500
And why is that?

365
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,375
Come on!

366
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:35,625
Because more troops are headed our way.

367
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,666
More troops than you can count.

368
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,875
And they're going to wipe you off the map.

369
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,458
Bullshit.

370
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:54,083
We have scouts watching every road.

371
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:59,375
They're not coming on the roads.

372
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:27,833
We're doomed.
