## Getting Started

## Word Table

## Foreign Subtitle Panel

## Primary Subtitle Panel

## Tools

## Export to Anki
There is future plans to have the application export directly to Anki using [Anki Connect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159), but for now you can export to CSV by going to (File->Export->CSV) and then within Anki, import the CSV file.
You will need to create a notecard template to import the csv data, or you can import the included deck (SubtitleWordFrequency.apkg) once which will create a card template for you called "Example Sentence".
